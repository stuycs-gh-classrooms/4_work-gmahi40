# Gaming the System

The purpose of both games are similar : to destroy the opposite side's pieces, whether they are aliens or blocks.
The elements controlled by the player in space invaders is the ability to shoot and move side to side, while in atari breakout, you can only move side to side.
The computer for space invaders controls the movement and shooting patterns of the aliens, and in atari, the computer handles ball movement and block behavior.
Mouse click to shoot, a and d to move left and right in space invaders; mouse xcor for atari breakout.
In breakout, the blocks are stagnant and are broken when the ball hits it; in space invaders, the aliens move in formation (like the homework we did in the past) and they shoot randomly.
Breakout : Ball, Paddle, Block classes; Space Invaders : Player, Invader, Fireball.
For Breakout, I would use an array to make the blocks, the array being one of objects. For space invaders, similarly, the array would be for the enemies, also being objects.
